What is Fusion 360 and CAD/CAM software?
Fusion 360 combines CAD and CAM applications into a single, well-integrated software. It includes all the tools you need to go from design to fabrication, without having to leave the platform.

Because of its easy-to-use design (CAD) to machining (CAM) workflows, it allows you to design and create prototypes from scratch, and finalize models to finished products.

Fusion 360 has a complete selection of data translators for 50 different file types, which means you can easily import files and get access to hundreds of posts from the Fusion 360 free post processor library to machine your product in Fusion 360â€™s CAM environment.
